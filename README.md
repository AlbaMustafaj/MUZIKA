# MUZIKA
A JavaScript based music playing/sharing web application developed as a group project for Database Systems course. It is based on the idea of a social network in which users can publish, buy and sell songs. 
A consumer can create/organize playlists with songs from several artists, follow artists, and connect with other consumers, share songs (and comments) with his/her connections. MySQL is used to implement the database system and PHP and AJAX are used for the backend implementation. Bootstrap, HTML, CSS are used for the UI and Javascript and PHP are used for the front and back end. Helper libraries are used to connect the back end of the system with the database.
